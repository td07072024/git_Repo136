By 10â€“14 million years ago, the hyena family had split into two distinct groups: dog-like hyenas and bone-crushing hyenas. The arrival of the ancestral bone-crushing hyenas coincided with the decline of the similarly built family Percrocutidae. The bone-crushing hyenas survived the changes in climate and the arrival of canids, which wiped out the dog-like hyenas, though they never crossed into North America, as their niche there had already been taken by the dog subfamily Borophaginae. By 5 million years ago, the bone-crushing hyenas had become the dominant scavengers of Eurasia, primarily feeding on large herbivore carcasses felled by sabre-toothed cats. One genus, Pachycrocuta, was a 110 kg (240 lb) mega-scavenger that could splinter the bones of elephants.[8][7] Starting in the early Middle Pleistocene Pachycrocuta was replaced by the smaller Crocuta and Hyena, which corresponds to a general faunal change, perhaps in connection to the Mid-Pleistocene transition.[9]
